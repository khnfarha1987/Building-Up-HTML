# Building-Up-HTML

# DOCTYPE declaration

# Head tag with a title tag

# H1 tag with a title of my choice

# Embedded image

# Three links that I will create:
 * Make the first link `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
 * Make the second link bold.
 * Make the third link a placeholder, so it goes nowhere.
